# Merging images using WinGDIPlus
This is a simple programm to merge 3 black and white immages taken by any camera with red, green and blue filters into one colour image. Just put the three .JPG immages named red.jpg, green.jpg and blue.jpg into IMAGES folder (bin\debug\) and run merge.exe. 
The result is merged.jpg in \bin\debug\.
Have fun!
